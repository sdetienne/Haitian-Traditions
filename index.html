       <h2>My Cultural Background</h2>
       <!--heading 2 is smaller font size than heading 1; sub-heading -->
  <p>Hi there! My name is Scherly Etienne, and I am Haitian American. My parents immigrated to the United States from the beautiful land of Haiti. They made sure to include our Haitian culture in my and my sister's lives. Through music, dance, food, historical triumphs, and traditions, we were able to appreciate all of what Haiti was and is.</p>

  <h2>Traditions</h2>
  <p>When I visit home during special holidays, I always look forward to having home-cooked Haitian meals made by my mother. I try to make dishes like she does, but I can't compare! I love the specific meals and sweets my family makes for different occasions/holidays or fun! Below are some examples.</p>
